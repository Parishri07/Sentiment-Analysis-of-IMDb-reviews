# Logistic-Regression-models

Data Import: Imported data for sentiment analysis as three files for train, test and validation.

Text Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared text data by removing stop words, special characters and numbers. Used Count Vectoriser to convert text into numerical features.

Data Visualization: Created box plots and word clouds to explore data characteristics.

Model Building: Used multiple algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine.

Evaluation: Achieved a 87% accuracy for Logistic Regression, 72% for Naive Bayes and 89% on SVM.
